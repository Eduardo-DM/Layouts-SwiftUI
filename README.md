# Layouts-SwiftUI

I think SwiftUI is more than an incredible framework for software developing. It can be used for design layouts and templates with excelent visual results and total control of each component of the creation.

## Background LinkedIn profile

So when I faced the creation of my LinkedIn and I didn't doubt in put in practice my previous statement. I used SwiftUI instead of any standard tool for create templates such as Canva or Photoshop.

The inspiration of the template was the last WWDC2022, I merged main ideas of the talk of Joshua Shaffer at the beginning of the State of the Union Keynote.

Code is BackgroundLinkedIn.swift

This is capture from the preview of Xcode:

## Vision for the future

I will create more templates, covers,... that will be placed in this repository.

I hope you like this repository and encourage you to go farther with the capabilities of SwiftUI.
